"[quacky.nl](https://quacky.nl)" (backup: [Github Pages](https://0xwdg.github.io/quacky.nl/)) is a website built for fun.
When we where at [Cafe Bax](https://www.cafebax.nl) for one of our weekly [Meeten and Drinken](https://appsterdam.rs/events/meeten-en-drinken/) events, we came up with the idea to ✨ Promote ✨ Jake's hotness.  
Then hot-jake.online was born, and we had a good laugh, but we wanted to do more.
can we make a website which quacks? 🦆 YES!

Other silly domainnames/services which i set up (in the past) include: [DateADeveloper.com](https://dateadeveloper.com) and [The-App-Team.com](https://the-app-team.com), [Hot-Jake.online](https://hot-jake.online), [Quacky.nl](https://quacky.nl).
